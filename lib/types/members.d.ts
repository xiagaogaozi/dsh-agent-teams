/**
 * Member subagent lifecycle: spawn a continuable child per member, deliver
 * messages into its FIFO inbox, and observe its activity.
 *
 * Members are durable continuable subagents of the captain, so a member keeps
 * its conversation across turns and across harness restarts: the captain
 * wakes it with {@link ctx.subagents.followup}, it works through its turn
 * (updating team state through the `agent_teams_*` tools), and becomes idle
 * again. Its final assistant message is not readable programmatically, so the
 * member persists its report into the captain's mailbox and the task records,
 * which the captain reads through `agent_teams_status`.
