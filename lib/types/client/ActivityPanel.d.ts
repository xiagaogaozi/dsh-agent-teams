/**
 * AgentTeams activity panel: the top-right floater monitoring every team.
 *
 * Modeled on the Claude Code desktop SessionActivityPanel: a fixed glass
 * panel at the top-right corner. On wide viewports it cooperatively makes the
 * conversation column yield space; narrow viewports keep overlay mode. It
 * polls the host `/plugins/dsh-agent-teams/state` route for
 * server-side snapshots (durable files + live subagent activity), with a
 * collapsed badge that stays collapsed until manually clicked. Archived
 * teams stay available for the owning conversation after live work ends.
 *
 * The floater mounts through a body portal (no top-right slot exists in the
 * web shell); it is not a conversation node — the in-conversation panel was
 * removed in favor of this always-available monitor.
 * @module dsh-agent-teams/client/activity
